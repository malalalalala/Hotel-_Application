### Features

A feature is based off the `develop` branch and merged back into the `develop` branch.
It will eventually get into `main` when we make a release.

### Working Locally

```
# checkout develop, fetch the latest changes and pull them from remote into local
git checkout develop
git fetch
git pull origin develop

# create a feature branch that is based off develop
git checkout -b feature/XXX-sprint-X

# do your work
git add something
git commit -m "first commit"
git add another
git commit -m "second commit"

# rebase against develop to pull in any changes that have been made
# since you started your feature branch.
git fetch
git rebase origin/develop
